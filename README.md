# Overview

This project was to understand how relational databases work. 
I learned how to start a database from scratch, and input data into each table.
I eventually made a database of fast food chains and all the information needed to understand a company. 

I wrote software that could gather and connect information about restaurants. 
By quantifying and separating each section of a franchise, you are able to see the layout with SQL language. This shows data and is able to store lots of information in an easy-to-read way. 

I wrote this in SQL to practice my proficiency in SQL. I also wanted to learn new syntax to decipher data structures.

# Relational Database

The Database I used in this project was MySQL. It has a way to reverse engineer tables to see all the relations each table has to one another.

The tables I created were the Store names, Locations of the stores, employees, Foods the store sold, and the prices for each food item. 

# Development Environment

I used SQL scripts and functions to pull queries. 

The language is SQL, and I don't believe I used any libraries.

# Future Work

- I could have improved by adding a relation table to show how many of the different stores could be in each city. 
- I could add more tables and make the correlations more intrecate.
- I could improve the way I enter data into each table to make it easier for me and not have to write each individual line.
